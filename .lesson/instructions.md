# Instructions

For this coding exercise, you will work on dictionaries.

Here is the learning outcomes for this exercise:
  1. Run a loop through all key:value pairs in a dictionary.
  2. Run a loop through all keys and all values separately in a dictionary.
  3. Create a list of dictionaries and run a loop through it.

## Steps
No.| To do
:-:|:-
1| In lines 7-13, you will recreate a familiar dictionary of food prices that you have worked on before.
2| In lines 16-18, this code creates a loop that goes through all key:value pairs in the dictionary and prints f-strings that access keys and values from the dictionary using the items() method.
3| In lines 30-38, create a new dictionary of city:average rent pairs that are found in lines 23-29. Afterwards print them in line 39.
4| In lines 42-44, this loop runs through all key:value pairs of your new dictionary.
5| In lines 47-48, this loop prints an f-string that includes key:value pairs. 
6| In lines 51-52, this loops runs through all keys from the dictionary using the keys() method.
7| In lines 55-56, this loop can check if a key is in the dictionary.
8| In lines 59-61, this loops through all the values in the dictionary.
9| In lines 64-68, create your own dictionary of your top 3 favorites restaurants (key) and how many times you have eaten or ordered from there in the past month (value). Afterwards, print your dictionary as in line 69.
10| Then, there's comments and codes on how to run loops on your new restaurant dictionary. First, create a loop that prints out the f-string that says "In the past month, I have eaten out {visit} times at {restaurant}." This is similar to the code  in lines 47-48.
11| Afterwards, create a for loop that prints out all the keys in your dictionary using the keys() method. This code is similar to lines 51-52.
12| Then, create a for loop that prints out all the values in your dictionary using the values() method. This code is similar to lines 60-61.
13| Finally, you will see and run code that nests. Basically you will create multiple dictionaries of avatars and their information. Then, you will create a list of these dictionaries. You will also learn how to run loops through this list of dictionaries & other manipulations that you can do with this! You do not have to write new code to make this portion run, but you can certainly feel free to play around with the keys and values and other aspects of this avatar dictionary list portion.
14| After running your code and checking everything, go to the Version Control icon on the leftmost sidebar & send commit to Github.

  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```
